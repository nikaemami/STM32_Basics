# STM32_Basics
Implementation of basic components like counter, timer, LCD display, external interrupt, PWM,  and digital pins on STM32 micro-controller.

The implementation of different ports and pins for the micro-controller is as follows:

<h3> &nbsp;Counter</h3>

A counter is implemented to count the number of times a push button on a micro controller pin has been pressed. The code corresponding to this component is in the main.c while loop as below:

<h3> &nbsp;Timer</h3>

Connected a timer to our STM32 micro controller that resets after some time to an initial value.  The code corresponding to this component is in the main.c while loop as below:

<h3> &nbsp;LCD Display</h3>

Connected an LCD to the STM32 micro controller, and printed my name and student number in its first two lines. The ports and pins corresponding to the LCD are as follows:
